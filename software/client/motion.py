"""
Defines classes for different types of motions.

Each motion is a subclass of a general motion class.
There are 4 primary motions: left, right, forward,
and backward. Each primary motion has a "code" associated
with it. This is the code that the wireless device transmits
to signal that that type of motion has occurred.
Composite motions or "gestures" can be made up by a sequence
of these primary motions.

Motion codes:
    0: Reserved. No motion can use this code
    1: Forward
    2: Right
    3: Backward
    4: Left
    5: Fast Forward
    6: Fast Right
    7: Fast Backward
    8: Fast Left
