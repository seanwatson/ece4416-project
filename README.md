Engineering 4th Year Design Project:
====================================
Wireless Control System Utilizing Head Movement
===============================================

Description
-----------

As part of the engineering degree program at The University of Western Ontario
all students must complete an eight month design project in their final year
of study. For my project I developed a wireless control system that utilizes
head movement as the input to the system. The goal was to improve accessibility
for patients with limited or no control of their limbs.

For demonstration purposes the device was designed to control the movement and
clicking of a mouse on a computer screen. The device consists of a small,
wearable circuit that is concealed within a baseball cap and software running
on the computer. When the device is within wireless range of the computer it
automatically connects with the computer over a bluetooth and
begins translating the user's head motions into mouse movements and clicks on the
screen.
